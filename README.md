# My TypeScript Learning Journey

This repository contains two projects that I've worked on to learn and master TypeScript. Each project focuses on different aspects of TypeScript, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

## 1. Project Manager Application

The first project is a Project Manager application, which is a simple web application for managing projects. This project is structured in a way that reflects my learning progression. It contains multiple `src` directories, each corresponding to a different learning step.

### 1.1 [01-project-manager/src (one-file)](01-project-manager/src%20(one-file))

This directory contains the initial version of the Project Manager application. It includes basic TypeScript features and concepts such as classes, interfaces, decorators, and basic type annotations.

### 1.2 [01-project-manager/src (namespace)](01-project-manager/src%20(namespace))

In this step, I explored the concept of namespaces in TypeScript. The application code is refactored to use namespaces for better organization and encapsulation.

### 1.3 [`01-project-manager/src`](01-project-manager/src)

This directory contains the final version of the Project Manager application. The application is structured using a modular approach, with separate files for classes, interfaces, and decorators. It also demonstrates the use of webpack to bundle the TypeScript code into a single JavaScript file.

## 2. Node.js Application with TypeScript

The second project is a Node.js application written in TypeScript, located in the [`02-nodejs`](02-nodejs) directory. This project assumes some prior knowledge of Node.js and focuses on applying TypeScript in a Node.js environment.

The application includes various TypeScript features such as classes, interfaces, and types, and how they can be used in a Node.js application. It also includes a demonstration of how to structure a Node.js application using controllers, models, and routes.

This repository represents my journey in learning TypeScript. It showcases the progression of my understanding of TypeScript, from basic syntax and concepts to more advanced features and real-world application. I hope it serves as a useful reference for others on their TypeScript learning journey.
